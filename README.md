**Build and install**

**Requirements**

- Xcode 9.2.0
- iOS 11.2 SDK
- Swift 3.1.

**Getting the code**

In order to build, run and access the app, the first thing you have to do is to clone my repository:

git clone https://github.com/RLRG/DancingSteps.git

**Running the app**

Open DancingSteps.xcworkspace with XCode 8.3.3. Then, it is recommended to install the app in a real device so that you can test the video recording functionality.

Before running it, note that there are two targets:

- DancingStepsLAB: When you run this target, in the &quot;Videos&quot; tab, you will see an UIBarButtonItem in the navigation bar (DEBUG) in order to open this debug screen. This target, then, includes tools to monitor and get information about the operation of the app in real time (real-time debuggers, logs and so on).
- DancingSteps: This target would be a simulation of the app if it was going to be submitted to the App Store.
